        "The machine learning component of this project focuses on predicting appointment attendance failure. We define attendance failure as any scheduled appointment in which the patient ultimately did not appear for care. The status field in the appointments table indicates whether each visit was completed, canceled in advance, or marked as a no-show. For modeling purposes, we grouped cancellations and no-shows together. Both outcomes represent appointments in which clinical resources were reserved but ultimately unused. This allows us to capture the full operational impact of missed visits.\n",
        "\n",
        "We converted the status field into the following binary target variable:\n",
        "\n",
        "    1 = Attendance failure (no-show or canceled)\n",
        "    0 = Completed visit\n",
        "\n",
        "This formulation structures the task as a supervised binary classification problem. It enables the model to learn patterns associated with missed appointments using historical appointment-level data.\n",
        "From an operational perspective, predicting attendance failures is highly relevant in healthcare settings. Both no-shows and cancellations reduce provider productivity and disrupt scheduling efficiency. They also complicate capacity planning and increase variability in clinic workflows. Additionally, attendance failures extend patient wait times and negatively affect continuity of care.\n",
        "\n",
        "Financially, attendance failures generate revenue loss. This occurs because clinical resources—staff time, exam rooms, and operational overhead—must still be reserved regardless of whether the patient attends. Early identification of high-risk appointments enables targeted interventions. These interventions may include automated reminders, personalized outreach, or optimized overbooking strategies to reduce scheduling volatility.\n",
        "Also, prior research emphasizes the significant operational burden associated with missed appointments. Outpatient attendance failure rates, including both cancellations and no-shows, commonly range between 10% and 30% across clinical settings. These failures contribute to efficiency losses and increased care delivery costs (Dantas et al., 2018; Machado et al., 2021)."

This function computes accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, predicted probabilities, the confusion matrix, and a full classification report. Using a single threshold (0.5) for all models allows their performance to be evaluated under identical decision conditions. This is an essential requirement in imbalanced classification tasks such as appointment attendance failure prediction.\n",

        "Random forest shows a more balanced profile. Although accuracy is similar to logistic regression (0.6230), recall improves substantially to 0.513, resulting in the highest F1-score (0.352) among the three models. This demonstrates that random forest is significantly better at detecting missed appointments, which aligns more closely with the project's operational objectives.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gradient boosting achieves the highest accuracy (0.7887) but performs poorly on recall (0.020) and F1-score (0.037). This suggests that the model is overly conservative and predicts almost all observations as completed visits. This leads to high accuracy but very limited utility for failure detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "These results show that accuracy alone is misleading due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset. The random forest model delivers the strongest balance between detecting failures (recall) and maintaining reliable precision. This makes it the most suitable model when the operational goal is to proactively identify high-risk appointments. The evaluation table therefore serves as a critical foundation for model selection. It highlights that models optimized for overall accuracy (e.g., gradient boosting) may underperform on clinically meaningful metrics such as recall and F1-score."

        "The ROC curve comparison, generated using scikit-learn's `roc_curve` function to compute false positive rates (FPR) and true positive rates (TPR) from the predicted probabilities of each model, visually illustrates the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity across various decision thresholds. Plotted with Matplotlib, the figure displays three curves: Logistic Regression AUC=0.624 performs best overall, hugging closest to the top-left corner and achieving the highest area under the curve, indicating superior discriminative ability in distinguishing attendance failures from completions. Random Forest AUC=0.603 follows closely but slightly underperforms Logistic, suggesting a balanced yet marginally less effective threshold-independent ranking of predictions. Gradient Boosting AUC=0.569 lags behind with the lowest AUC, its curve is nearer to the dashed \"No Skill\" diagonal line AUC=0.5, implying limited utility in this imbalanced task despite high accuracy elsewhere—likely due to conservative predictions favoring the majority class. Overall, the ROC curves reveal modest discriminative ability across all three models, with AUC values clustering between 0.57 and 0.62. The narrow range suggests that all models struggle to fully separate failed appointments from completed visits, reflecting the difficulty of the prediction task given the limited signal in the features. Despite the moderate AUCs, all models outperform the no-skill baseline, indicating that they are capturing meaningful patterns. Logistic regression's superior AUC suggests that linear decision boundaries are slightly more effective in this particular dataset than tree-based ensemble methods. Nevertheless, the ROC curves also highlight the need for threshold adjustments, as none of the models deliver strong true-positive rates at the default cutoff. This visualization reinforces that while all models outperform random guessing, Logistic Regression offers the strongest threshold-agnostic performance, aligning with its edge in AUC from the metrics table, and highlights the need for models that better capture minority-class signals in healthcare no-show prediction."

        "In the plot, `num_previous_no_shows` dominates at approximately 0.33, underscoring that a patient's history of missed appointments is by far the strongest predictor of future attendance failures, which aligns with clinical literature on behavioral patterns in no-show models. ID-based features like `appointment_id` (0.11), `doctor_id` (0.07), and `patient_id` (0.05) rank highly, suggesting they capture latent operational signals such as scheduling clusters or provider-specific tendencies, though this raises concerns about potential overfitting or reduced generalizability in deployment. Healthcare utilization metrics, including `num_invoices` (0.08), `num_prescriptions` (0.07), and `num_previous_appointments` (0.06), follow closely, indicating that frequent system interactions may correlate with reliability. Lower-ranked features like `avg_amount_paid` (0.05), `reason_for_visit` (0.04), and `appointment_hour` (0.04) contribute modestly, while demographics play a lesser role overall.\n",
